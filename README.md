# :partly_sunny: Weather App

The Weather App project brings together the concepts of Promises, Callbacks, APIs, Object Oriented Programming, Factory Functions, Module Pattern, Single Responsibility and Tightly Coupled Objects.  
To handle the complexity of synchronizing the views with data changes, I created an Observable object on which can be attached handlers. The `Observable class` is located in `./src/utils.js`.  
Also the app takes care of updating the information every **10mn** as it is recommended by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/appid).  
This project is part of [microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) curriculum.
